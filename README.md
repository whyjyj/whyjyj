### Hi there! 👋

I'm a Master's student in the **Graduate School of Artificial Intelligence** at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH). As a member of the **Computer Vision Lab**, I am conducting research under the supervision of [Prof. Suha Kwak](https://suhakwak.github.io/).

My research interests lie in computer vision and deep learning, with a special focus on applying **Video Understanding** and **Embodied AI** to enable intelligent agents to operate effectively in the real world.
